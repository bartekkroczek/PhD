Transparency repository for my doctoral dissertation entitled ***"Does attention in perceptual
tasks change over time?"***

Here you can find everything to reproduce the experiments I performed, i.e.
the codes of the experimental procedures, raw and processed data, notebooks
with analyzes and the final manuscript.

This project is supervised by Professor **Adam Chuderski**.

## Short abstract

Whether the stimulus discrimination performance increases (e.g., due to goal strengthening),
decreases (e.g., due to vigilance decay), or varies periodically (e.g., along attentional rhythms)
as a function of time elapsing between task onset (fixation point, cue) and stimulus
(cue-stimulus interval; CSI) is debated in the current literature on attention, and so 
far the findings have not been unequivocal. The aim of the project is to study the dynamics of 
the stimulus discrimination performance in the antisaccade task.

## Project stages

### Experiment 1
**Research Question**: Does varying cue-stimulus interval affect the sensory
discrimination performance in the antisaccade task?  
**Task**: Antisaccade task. [Details here](google.com)  
**Task specification**: [1a here](google.com) and [1b here](google.com)

**Data A:** 150 participants, CSI range 216-1000 wth 16.(6) ms step [Available here](google.com)  
**Data B:** 40 participants, CSI range 400-900ms in 8ms step. [Available here](google.com)  
> :warning: Due to COVID-19 related lockdown study was interrupted after 9 participants. That's why data are splitted 
>	into two Cohorts. Both cohorts did exactly the same procedure. 

#### Analysis 1
**Question:** Does stimulus discrimination performance oscillate?  
**Description:** xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx. [Details here](google.com)  
**Notebook:** [Here](google.com)  
**Result:** xxxxxxxxxxxxx
#### Analysis 2
**Question:** Does stimulus discrimination performance has a trend?  
**Description:** xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx. [Details here](google.com)  
**Notebook:** [Here](google.com)
**Result:** xxxxxxxxxxxxx
#### Conclusion
No effect of CSI on stimulus discriminaton accuracy up to 1 sec.

### Experiment 2 

**Research Question:** Does increasing or decreasing trend (or very slow oscillations) 
in the sensory discrimination performance occurs in a broader CSI range?  
**Task:** Same as in Experiment 1  
**Task specification**: [here](google.com)   
**Data:** Up to 300, during study Y


### Experiment 3 

**Research Question:** If not attention fluctuations determine performance in visual
discrimination tasks, then what? Rouder, 2022 replication.  
**Tasks**: Anti and prosaccade [(details here)](google.com), inspection time [(details here)](google.com), 
temporal order judgement appear/disappear [(details here)](google.com)  
**Tasks specifications:**   
**Data:** 50 participants

### Simulation 1 

**Research question:** Why the commonly reported behavioral oscillations did not show up in our results?
