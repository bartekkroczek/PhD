Task and Stimuli

Participants performed a computerized prosaccade (PS) and antisaccade (AS) arrow-identification task implemented in PsychoPy. On each trial, a central fixation cross (“+”) was presented for 30 frames (500 ms), followed by a variable interstimulus interval (ISI) of 25–50 frames (417–833 ms). A peripheral cue (a dark red circle; radius 20 pixels) then appeared at either ±600 pixels from fixation, blinking three times at an alternation rate of 60 Hz (~100 ms total). In PS trials, the target stimulus—one of four arrow symbols (←, →, ↑, ↓; size 25 pixels)—was presented at the cued location; in AS trials, the target appeared at the mirror-opposite location. Target presentation duration was adaptively adjusted (see Procedure). Immediately following target offset, a pattern mask (size matched to the target) was displayed for 10 frames (167 ms) or until response. Participants indicated the direction of the arrow by pressing the corresponding arrow key (left, right, up, down). Reaction times (RTs) were recorded from target onset via a frame-synchronized clock. A maximum response window of 90 frames (1500 ms) was allowed; if no response occurred during mask presentation, a response prompt appeared, and responses were collected until the 1500 ms deadline.

Procedure

The session began with two training blocks of fixed-duration trials: 10 PS trials with a target duration of 30 frames (500 ms), followed by 10 AS trials with a target duration of 45 frames (750 ms). These initial trials familiarized participants with the respective oculomotor mapping rules. Subsequently, two adaptive staircases (2-up-1-down rule) were administered separately for PS and AS tasks to estimate individual target-duration thresholds. Each staircase started at 30 frames (PS) or 45 frames (AS) and terminated after four reversals.

The main experiment consisted of eight task blocks, presented in a counterbalanced order across participants (half received the sequence [PS, AS, AS, PS, PS, AS, AS, PS]; half received [AS, PS, PS, AS, AS, PS, PS, AS]). At the start of each block, participants completed five intra-block training trials at 1.5× the previously estimated threshold duration. Thereafter, an adaptive 2-up-1-down staircase (starting at the participant’s threshold, terminating after 14 reversals) controlled target durations for the experimental trials. Short rest breaks were provided between blocks, during which a full-screen break image was displayed and advanced at the participant’s pace.

Apparatus and Data Acquisition

Stimuli were presented in full-screen mode on a monitor with a measured refresh rate of 60 Hz and resolution obtained at session onset. All temporal parameters were specified in frames and converted to milliseconds based on the frame rate measurement. Behavioral data—including trial type, stimulus parameters, key press, RT, correctness, and staircase status (level, reversal count)—were logged on each trial and saved to a CSV file at session completion.
