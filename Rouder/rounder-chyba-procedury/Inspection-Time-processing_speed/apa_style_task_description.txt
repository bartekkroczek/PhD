Method

Apparatus and Stimuli
The experiment was conducted on a computer (1920 × 1080 pixels; 60 Hz refresh rate) running PsychoPy under Python. Stimuli were presented on a uniform gray background and comprised black geometric shapes. In the Squares Task, each trial displayed two filled squares (2° × 2° visual angle), one rotated by 45° (target) and one unrotated (foil). In the Circles Task, each trial displayed two filled circles (2° diameter), one 20% larger (target) and one smaller (foil). Stimuli appeared at 4° eccentricity to the left and right of a central fixation cross (0.5° visual angle). A pattern mask matching stimulus dimensions was presented immediately after stimulus offset for 17 frames (283 ms).

Procedure
Each trial began with a fixation cross displayed for 45 frames (750 ms), followed by a stimulus pair presented for a variable stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA; 1 frame ≈ 16.7 ms) and then the mask. Participants were prompted to indicate the target location by pressing the left or right arrow key when arrow cues were displayed for up to 240 frames (4,000 ms). The intertrial interval varied randomly between 45 and 60 frames (750–1,000 ms).

Training Phase
Prior to each task, participants completed two practice blocks (10 trials each) at fixed SOAs. For the Squares Task, SOAs were 12 frames (200 ms) and 6 frames (100 ms); for the Circles Task, SOAs were 20 frames (333 ms) and 10 frames (167 ms). Trial-by-trial feedback (“Poprawna odpowiedź”/“Niepoprawna odpowiedź”) was displayed for 30 frames (500 ms) following each response.

Experimental Phase
Participants then completed one adaptive staircase block per task using a 2-up/1-down rule: two consecutive correct responses decreased the SOA by one frame, and one incorrect response increased the SOA by one frame. Staircases began at 6 frames (100 ms) for the Squares Task and 10 frames (167 ms) for the Circles Task, terminating after 10 reversals. Accuracy, reaction time, and SOA were recorded on each trial.

Data Analysis
Behavioral responses (accuracy, reaction time) and trial-by-trial SOA values were logged. Inspection time thresholds were computed offline as the mean SOA across reversal trials.
