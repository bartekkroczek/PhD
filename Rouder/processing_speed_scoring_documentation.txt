=====================================

RELIABILITY ISSUES:
- Temporal Order α = 0.349 
- Inspection Time α = 0.536 
- Both below acceptable threshold of 0.70

RECOMMENDED SCORING:
1. Use individual standardized items (e.g., temporal_squares_z)
2. Avoid composite scores due to low reliability
3. Consider measurement error in interpretation

VARIABLES IN OUTPUT FILE:
- temporal_circles_z: Standardized temporal order (circles)
- temporal_squares_z: Standardized temporal order (squares)
- inspection_circles_z: Standardized inspection time (circles)
- inspection_squares_z: Standardized inspection time (squares)
- temporal_mean: Mean of temporal items (USE WITH CAUTION)
- inspection_mean: Mean of inspection items (USE WITH CAUTION)
