<p>In psychology it is common to use the related concepts of
<em>cognitive control</em>, <em>inhibition</em>, <em>executive
function</em>, and <em>self regulation</em> to construct theories of
attention, intelligence, working memory, development, aging, and
psychopathology. The <em>structure</em> of cognitive control, therefore,
has been a central, cross-domain topic for over three decades. There
have been a number of competing views of cognitive control. One popular
position is that cognitive control is a common, domain-general, unified
concept that is engaged in many tasks <span
class="citation">[@Engle.etal.1999;@Kane.etal.2001]</span>. Alternatives
to this position come in two varieties. One is a finer subdivision of
these general abilities including the proactive-vs-reactive dual-process
model of <span class="citation">@Braver.2012</span>, and the exceedingly
popular three-factor model of <span
class="citation">@Miyake.etal.2000</span>. The other variety is that
cognitive control does not exist in a general form; instead it is
comprised of several, independent, domain-specific abilities <span
class="citation">[@Rey-Mermet.etal.2018]</span>.</p>
<p>One main-line behavioral approach to exploring the structure of
cognitive control is to apply latent variable models to individual
performance scores. A brief summary is as follows: Individuals complete
a battery of cognitive control exercises such as the Stroop task <span
class="citation">[@Stroop.1935]</span>, the flanker task <span
class="citation">[@Eriksen.Eriksen.1974]</span>, the anti-saccade task
<span class="citation">[@Kane.etal.2001]</span>, the N-back memory task
<span class="citation">[@Cohen.etal.1994]</span>, and the stop-signal
task <span
class="citation">[@Logan.Cowan.1984;@Verbruggen.etal.2019]</span>. Then,
the covariation across scores is decomposed into latent variables <span
class="citation">[@Bollen.1989;@Skrondal.Rabe-Hesketh.2004]</span>. The
relations among these latent variables purportedly reveal the underlying
structure of cognitive control processes.</p>
<p>Results from latent-variable analyses have not been as conclusive or
convincing as one might hope. The problem is that several of the
experimental tasks which supposedly measure cognitive control do not
correlate well with each other. For example, the correlation between
flanker and Stroop effects in large studies is often near zero and never
greater than .25 <span
class="citation">[@Rouder.etal.inpreparation]</span>. It is difficult to
determine whether these low correlations reflect a true lack of
underlying correlation or attenuation from excessive measurement error
<span class="citation">[@Hedge.etal.2018;@Rouder.Haaf.2019]</span>.
Additionally, extant latent-variable analyses with cognitive-control
tasks have been shown to be computationally unreliable <span
class="citation">[@Karr.etal.2018]</span>.</p>
<p>Why are the correlations so low across scores? It is useful to
partition cognitive control scores into those from <em>tasks</em> and
those from <em>measures</em>. Tasks are true experiments where Donders’
subtractive logic <span class="citation">[@Donders.1868]</span> is used
to localize a process of interest. Two conditions are constructed where
the only difference between them is that the process of interest loads
more highly on to one than the other. The contrast of the conditions
allows for a measure of the process free from nuisance factors. An
example is the Stroop task where cognitive control is needed more for
the incongruent than the congruent condition, and the subtraction
provides a measure of cognitive control free from factors such as
overall speed or motivation. Measures are instruments that do not have
conditions nor use Donders’ subtraction method. Cognitive-control
measures include antisaccade accuracy, card-sorting performance and
working-memory span. Performance typically reflects the composite of
several skills and processes including but not limited to cognitive
control.</p>
<p>The problem in measuring cognitive control has been with tasks. As
several researchers have shown, the resulting difference scores are
excessively variable even when there are 100s of trials per condition
per participant <span
class="citation">[@Draheim.etal.2019;@Hedge.etal.2018;@Rouder.etal.inpreparation]</span>.
The statistical bright spot has been with measures. Because measures do
not involve a subtraction, they tend to have higher reliability in
typically-sized sample <span
class="citation">[@Draheim.etal.2019]</span>. The problem with measures,
however, is their interpretation. Whether measures index cognitive
control is more-or-less asserted <em>prima facie</em> without recourse
to experimental-manipulation logic. Researcher who use measures rely on
their correlations with other purportedly similar measures to bolster
their interpretability. For example, the correlation between
working-memory span and antisaccade accuracy is interpreted as coming
from a shared factor of cognitive control <span
class="citation">[@Unsworth.etal.2021]</span>.</p>
<p>A laudable goal in our view is to find a unicorn task or measure for
cognitive control. Such a task or measure would have high reliability in
reasonable sample sizes and clearly index cognitive control. The
question then is whether such task exists. Perhaps the best candidate
comes from the antisaccade paradigm shown in Figure @ref(fig:trial)
<span class="citation">[@Kane.etal.2001;@Unsworth.etal.2021]</span>.
Here, the cue precedes the target, and cues and targets are presented on
opposite sides of fixation. There is an automatic orientation to the cue
<span class="citation">[@Guitton.etal.1985]</span>, and this orientation
response must be successfully inhibited to process the target before it
is masked. In the antisaccade task, cognitive control is manifest as the
ability to inhibit prepotent automatic orienting responses, and the
performance to the target, then, reflects the degree of control. In this
indirect version, where stimulus information is available only briefly
before masking, the accuracy to the target serves as a suitable measure
of performance. Individual differences in target accuracy are known to
have good reliability and correlate moderately well with working memory,
problem-solving ability and other cognitive control measures <span
class="citation">[@Chuderski.Jastrzebski.2018;@Friedman.Miyake.2004;@Unsworth.etal.2021]</span>.</p>
<p>We emphasize that the antisaccade paradigm is a measure rather than a
task as there is often no manipulation or contrast. It is possible to
construct a task with both antisaccade and prosaccade conditions. The
prosaccade condition, where the cue and target are at the same location,
serves as a baseline where cognitive control—the inhibition of the
prepotent response to the cue—is counterproductive. Hence, we assume
that when participants are aware that they are in a prosaccade
condition, as they are in the following between-block design, they do
not engage cognitive control. Individual differences in prosaccade
accuracy are expected of course, and these may reflect differences in
the speed to shift gaze to the target location and the speed to process
briefly-flashed stimuli, or, more generically, <em>processing speed</em>
<span class="citation">[@Salthouse.1996]</span>. Antisaccade accuracy
presumably indexes not only processing speed but cognitive control as
well. The contrast between the prosaccade and antisaccade condition then
may be used to isolate this control component much the same way that the
contrast between incongruent and congruent conditions are used to
isolate inhibition of prepotent responses in the Stroop tasks.</p>
<p>Researchers occasionally run prosaccade and antisaccade accuracy
conditions in their experiments with the former serving as practice or
filler. Importantly, contrasts are not constructed from the conditions
<span class="citation">[e.g.,
@Kane.etal.2001;@Unsworth.etal.2021]</span>. The exception is <span
class="citation">@Rey-Mermet.etal.2018</span> who tuned stimulus target
duration for each participant in their antisaccade task from an adaptive
staircase in a preceding prosaccade task. This tuning serves as a
control for individual differences in the ability to identify briefly
flashed targets.</p>
<p>Constructing a contrast between prosaccade and antisaccade conditions
is beset with the following practical problem: There is no single target
duration that works well for both prosaccade and antisaccade conditions.
If the target duration is tuned for the prosaccade condition, then
performance is at floor in the antisaccade condition, and, if the target
duration is tuned for the antisaccade condition, then performance is at
ceiling for the prosaccade condition. To mitigate this problem, we used
a simple adaptive staircase procedure to adjust the target duration for
each individual separately in the prosaccade and antisaccade conditions.
With the 2-down/1-up procedure <span
class="citation">[@Levitt.1971;@Treutwein.1995]</span>, we were able to
ascertain a characteristic target duration that corresponded to 71%
accuracy for each individual in each condition. The duration in the
prosaccade condition indexes a processing speed component without
inhibition of the prepotent eye-movement response; the duration in the
antisaccade condition indexes a combination of processing speed and
inhibition of prepotent eye-movement responses; and, perhaps, the
contrast may serve as a suitable measure of cognitive control.</p>
<p>The key prediction is about the correlation among the prosaccade and
antisaccade condition. Of course we expect some correlation as both the
prosaccade and antisaccade task tap many of the same processes including
how well individuals can process quickly flashed targets with backwards
masking. But we should not expect too high of a correlation if the
antisaccade task taps cognitive control and the cognitive-control
component is the dominant in accounting for individual differences. But
what if the correlation is quite high? Then the antisaccade performance
can be well predicted from the prosaccade performance. In this case, it
is difficult to interpret antisaccade performance as localizing
cognitive control; instead the antisaccade measure should be thought of
as tapping the same processes as the prosaccade condition.</p>
<p>In the following experiment we use a between-block design in which
participants performed in the same condition for 50 trials before
alternating to the other condition. The other design choice would have
been a within-block design where conditions could switch from trial to
trial. The between-design choice has the following advantages: (i) it
limits the possibility of a carry-over effect of inhibition from
antisaccade trials to prosaccade trials, (ii) it eliminates any
task-switching costs, (iii) it takes shorter to run as task-indicating
cues are not required, and (iv) the antisaccade condition is similar to
antisaccade-accuracy measures used in cognitive-control batteries <span
class="citation">[cf., @Unsworth.etal.2004]</span>.</p>
<div id="method" class="section level1">
<h1>Method</h1>
<p><strong>Subjects.</strong> Twenty-six students from Brywn Mawr
College participated in exchange for course credit or $10. This sample
was the largest one we could obtain before the semester ended. Although
a sample size of 26 is not recommended for correlational studies in
general, the resulting correlations are quite high and the subsequent
analyzes confirm that the sample size is sufficient in this case to
localize latent correlations.</p>
<p><strong>Apparatus.</strong> Participants were run individually on a
PC running Windows. The experiment was controlled by a Python 3.6
program using Psychopy 3 libraries <span
class="citation">[@Peirce.etal.2019]</span>. The display was an ordinary
19” LCD running with a resolution of <span class="math inline">\(1440
\times 900\)</span> pixels<span class="math inline">\(^2\)</span> at a
refresh rate of 75hz.</p>
<p><strong>Design.</strong> The main dependent measure of interest is
the stimulus duration obtained in an adaptive staircase procedure. The
main independent variable is whether the cue is located around the
target (prosaccade condition) or whether the cue is located 180<span
class="math inline">\(^\circ\)</span> from the target (antisaccade
condition). This variable was manipulated within participant and was
blocked so that the participant always knew whether the trial was in the
prosaccade or antisaccade condition.</p>
<p><strong>Procedure.</strong> Participants were flashed either X or M
as a target on each trial, and they had to indicate whether this target
was an M or an X by depressing the corresponding key on a computer
keyboard. The structure of an antisaccade trial is shown in Figure
@ref(fig:trial). The target was placed at a certain angle relative to
fixation, with all angles equally likely. In the antisaccade task, the
cue consisted of two radial segments at an angle 180<span
class="math inline">\(^\circ\)</span> from the target (as shown). For
the prosaccade trials (not shown), the cue was presented at the same
angle as the target. In pilot work, we confirmed that cues were
sufficiently separated from targets as to not cause any meta-contrast
masking effects. Timing of the events are shown in Figure
@ref(fig:trial) with the last blank lasting until response. After that,
participants were provided feedback. They heard a pleasant 2-tone
sequence for correct responses and a longer, lower tone for error
responses.</p>
<p>Staircasing followed a 2-down/1-up procedure where the increments
were single refreshes at 75hz (13.3 ms). Experimental blocks were
comprised of 50 trials. The initial target duration in antisaccade
blocks was 120ms (9 frames); that in prosaccade blocks was 66.7 ms (5
frames). The first two blocks were designed as practice blocks to
familiarize the participant with the task. They consisted of only 10
trials and the target duration was started at 267 ms (20 frames). The
first of these was a prosaccade block; the second was an antisaccade
block. These 2 practice blocks were followed with the six experimental
blocks of 50 trials each described above. The order of these 6 blocks
followed an ABBAB design: some participants performed an antisaccade
block; other performed a prosaccade block first.</p>

Prosaccade trials were the same with the exception that the cue and
target appeared at the same angle relative to fixation.

<p>One participant was discarded because their staircases across all
blocks increased without reaching any steady-state. This participant may
have reversed the key mappings.</p>
<p>In the staircasing procedure, the goal is to describe the
steady-state value after a transitory period from the initial value.
There are a number of choices and we tried several options including
discarding a fixed number of initial trials or discarding trials before
a set number of reversals <span class="citation">[@Levitt.1971]</span>.
None of these choices had more than a marginal effect on the results.
Herein, we discarded the first 15 trials of each 50-trial block and
averaged the duration values on the remaining 35 trials to form a block
score. Additionally, the first experimental block in each condition was
discarded because learning effects were apparent for some participants.
The results change only marginally if we include these two blocks.</p>

<h2>Observed Relationships</h2>
<p>The contrast between antisaccade and prosaccade durations provides a
task-based localization of cognitive control. The relationship between
this index and prosaccade performance is shown in Figure
@ref(fig:scatter)B. There is a large degree of correlation here as well.
To the degree that this contrast localizes a cognitive-control process,
it too is well predicted by processing speed in the prosaccade task. The
remaining scatter plot, that between the contrast and the antisaccade
duration performance is shown in Figure @ref(fig:scatter)C, and the
exceedingly high correlation, <span
class="math inline">\(r=0.97\)</span>, shows that the variability in the
contrast reflects the variability in the antisaccade task more than
variability in the prosaccade task.</p>
<p>The above correlation of .83 between prosaccade and antisaccade
performance can be restated as follows: the prosaccade condition
predicts about 70% of the variance in the antisaccade condition. The
critical question is about the remaining 30%. On one hand, it could be
the systematic variation across individuals in inhibition of prepotent
eye-movement responses. If this possibility holds, then indeed the
antisaccade accuracy task may be interpreted as reflecting individual
differences in processing speed and cognitive control. On the other
hand, however, the remaining 30% of variation may be unaccounted
measurement error. In this case, there is only one dimension or factor
of systematic variation, and this dimension cannot be cognitive control
as inhibition of the orienting cue is counterproductive in the
prosaccade condition. In the current design, where each staircase in
each condition is repeated within individuals, it is possible to assess
whether this remaining 30% is systematic variation with mixed linear
models.</p>
<p>We construct a series of hierarchical models to account for
measurement error and various systematic structures. The first model,
<span class="math inline">\({\cal M}_1\)</span>, is an unstructured
model to separate the two sources of variation. This first model is
followed by two others with successive degrees of structure. The
residual variabilities from the three models are compared much like one
compares reduction in <span class="math inline">\(R^2\)</span> from
adding more covariates in linear models.</p>
</div>

<div id="conclusions" class="section level1">
<h1>Conclusions</h1>
<p>Because only a single factor is needed to account for over 97% of the
systematic individual variation across the two conditions, it seems
unreasonable to interpret the antisaccade performance as having any
systematic variation that is independent from prosaccade performance.
The difference between the conditions is that inhibition of the
prepotent automatic response to the cue is required in the antisaccade
condition while it is unnecessary and counterproductive in the
prosaccade condition. Hence, any variation in the inhibition of the
orienting cue in the antisaccade task reflects variation in processing
speed rather than an independent cognitive control construct.</p>
<p>Antisaccade conditions are not unicorn tasks for measuring cognitive
control. They may be, however, unicorn tasks for measuring processing
speed. Covariation across prosaccade performance, antisaccade
performance, and the contrast indicate that prosaccade and antisaccade
tasks index a processing speed factor that reflects the ability to
identify briefly masked targets.</p>
<p>One of the theoretical weaknesses in a processing speed account is
that processing speed itself is a vague concept. It is often
operationalized in the individual-differences literature as
<em>inspection time,</em> or the time needed to identify
briefly-flashed-and subsequently masked stimuli. And inspection time not
only varies reliably across people, but correlates well with
higher-order tasks such as working memory and intelligence tasks <span
class="citation">[@Deary.Stough.1996;@Jensen.2006]</span>. Nonetheless,
it is unclear how the time needed to identify briefly flashed items maps
to theoretical concepts such as perception, representation, attention,
or evidence accumulation. We highlight the recent work of <span
class="citation">@Schubert.etal.2017</span> as it addresses in part this
gap. These researchers used the onset times of electrophysiological
event-related components as proxies for various mental processes. The
results were a positive manifold on individuals latent ERP components,
that is, each individual had a characteristic latent processing time
constant across the components. They concluded that this characteristic
time likely reflects brain-wide differences in the efficiency of
information transfer.</p>
<p>The processing speed, while characteristic of individual differences,
is not the only factor that determines prosaccade and antisaccade
performance. Some empirical manipulations have opposing effects on
prosaccade and antisaccade performance. One example is the effect of the
side of presentation in a monocular presentation <span
class="citation">[@Kristjansson.etal.2004]</span>. Saccades are quicker
to temporal-hemifield presentations than nasal-hemifield presentation in
the prosaccade condition while quicker to nasal-hemifield presentations
than temporal-hemifield presentation in the antisaccade condition. The
result seemingly reflects an overall bias toward temporal hemifield
movements. Another example comes from base-rate manipulations <span
class="citation">[@Massen.2004]</span>. Increasing the proportion of
antisaccade trials in a mixed block both speeds eye-movement latencies
for antisaccade trials and slows them for prosaccade trials. Hence,
there are other processes in play, say faster eye movements to the
periphery and sensitivity to expectations from base rates. Regardless,
variation across individuals is highly correlated and concordant with a
single factor indicating that variation in processing speed plays an
outsized role.</p>
<p>The staircased antisaccade task is particularly attractive from a
psychometric viewpoint. Because individual’s durations vary to a far
greater degree than the measurement error, highly reliable scores may be
obtained in reasonably-sized samples. A single block of 100 trials
comprised of two interleaved staircases should be sufficient to provide
a highly reliable antisaccade accuracy score <span
class="citation">[@Draheim.etal.2021]</span>. Such a block takes only 5
minutes to run and may be used in clinical as well as experimental
settings. Our results show that researchers who use antisaccade accuracy
measures should not interpret them as cognitive control scores but
rather as processing speed scores.</p>
