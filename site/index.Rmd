Transparency website for my doctoral dissertation entitled **Does the attention vigilance varies on time in sensory discrimination tasks?**
 "Cognitive Neuroscience" PhD program at the Institute of Psychology,
Jagiellonian University, Cracow, Poland.  
This project is under the supervision of professor **Adam Chuderski**.

Here you can find everything to reproduce the experiments I performed, i.e. the codes of the experimental procedures,
raw and processed data, notebooks with analyzes and the final manuscript. Moreover, to give you an insight into the different stages of the work, you can find here a detailed diary describing the steps taken and the rationale for 
the most important decisions.

In case of any questions, I'm available at **bartek.kroczek (at) doctoral.uj.edu.pl**
