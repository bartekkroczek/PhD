Part_155 is corrupted - participant wasn't cooperative. That's why .csvx suffix.

Some trials was broken, particularly:
HIGH_RES PART 163 SESSION 4 Item 1008
HIGH RES PART 157 SESSION 4 Item 1006
Data_B PART 101    Item 445 
Data_B PART 123    Item 298
Data_A PART  28    Item 297
Data_A PART  32    Item 298
Data_A PART  38    Item 299
Data_A PART  69    Item 445

Items was removed, original files in .csvx copies

Issues: 
RC-M-23 - Session 2; task manager was started by participant mistake
AC-K-26 - Session 2; task manager was started by participant mistake
AK-K-23 - Session 2; unexpected procedure crash (at the end, no data impact)
